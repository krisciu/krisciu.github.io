# Who Am I?

My name is Joe Krisciunas, I'm yet another Software Engineer who lives in Seattle!

Professionally, I work on cloud applications, and mainly focus on backend Software Engineering

My best languages are probably Java, Python, and Typescript, and my hobby language is mainly Golang.



In the rare few moments i'm not working on something technology related, you can find me going on walks, reading books, playing music, or riding my bike.

I am a schemer by nature, and am always working on some kind of crazy project or side-hustle.

Here are links to my pages!
