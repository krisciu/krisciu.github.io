# Upskilling


### We're on a mission from [the machine] God

Here's the simple truth i've concluded through playing around with modern AI/ML recently.

The AI hype is hype, that's true, but..... it also probably is the biggest thing since the internet.

I don't know what our timelines look like, we might have AGI in 10 years, and paperclification in 12, but I kind of doubt it.

Even assuming AI progress halts now, the world is irreversibly changed, yes, ChatGPT is already, and has been, coming for your job.

I am quite painfully aware that, if I want to continue being competitive,I need to upskill. 

ChatGPT cannot replace me yet, and I don't think it will soon, but maybe I'm just myopic.

Being in the tech space has always involved learning the newest technologies and  keeping yourself sharp, and it's no different now.

While I highly doubt that SWE's will be on the street in 5 years, there are going to be serious  consequences for those who do not start learning AI/ML NOW!

This page is a way for me to compile my progress towards my own personal journey to upskill.

I do eventually want to take a more structured approach, but for now I am letting passion and interest guide me, this might just be laziness, we shall see.

The general ethos is that, in order to learn, I must produce, while hypothetically I could just pore over textbooks, I will be aiming to produce content and concrete output.

This is, IMO, the best way to both learn and fulfill my goals of upskilling.

This index is my notes page, I will jot things down here related to my journey. 

This page will likely be a mess, but that's ok, it's just meant to be notes and ramblings.

If no one told you this today, it's okay, we're all going to make it! We just have to keep learning.


### What have I done so far?

I'm very busy, but I still feel i've been slacking. It's time to get serious about this, let's list what I've learned, and what I'm working on(as of September 25 2023):

1. Started a Substack, check it out [here](https://committothebit.substack.com/)
    
    I publish the occasional article here, this is mainly for long term content related to ML/AI, I aim to keep producing articles for this. I will also be cross-posting them on Medium, but that's really just for reach.

2. Ran an AI/ML Twitch stream to teach lessons over [here](https://www.twitch.tv/1bit2far)
   
   This ran for about 3 weeks, and I did learn a lot doing it. However, It was a ton of work, with relatively little payoff, so I decided to PIVOT, as is the techbro way.
   I have some good notes and material from these streams over [here](https://github.com/krisciu/SurvivingtheSingularity/tree/main/Lesson_3).
   You can see Jupyter Notebook files, and the lessons themselves in PDF format.
   Overall it was a fun little experiment, and a great way to motivate myself to get started on this journey

3. Then I ran a Youtube channel, check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjIECuQuXJhh6qqWX1oA9EQ)
   This had some good content, and I was quite happy with my videos. I want to make more of these in the near future. Ultimately, I do want to pivot the channel a little bit however.
   The main reason is that, while I very much enjoyed learning the theory, I want to focus more on application, as I find it more interesting and useful to accomplish my goals.
   I definitely still want to learn the theory, but I did nothing but that for a few months, and I feel I am the type who learns more by building. That being said I definitely still want to work on this and make more video content. 

4. Projects I'm currently working on:

    I have a[currently-unnamed] project utilizing Langchain and the OpenAI APIs to attempt to learn working with modern LLM frameworks. I will probably be posting a lot of updates about this here.

    I also have this page! Which I'm honestly making just because I'm too burned out to work on my [currently-unnamed] project
