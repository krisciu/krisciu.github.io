## What did I accomplish?

1. Got this site up :)
2. Got 8+ hours of sleep[actually horrible, was exhausted all day]
3. Got some bug fixing done on app[not as much as I wanted]


## What did I fail at?
1. Struggled to get out of bed in the morning
2. Need to be more direct @ work
3. Did not get nearly as much accomplished as I wanted to today


## What needs to be done?
1. Have a bug with sessions not being initialized correctly/retrieved in app
2. get a good nights sleep
3. work on improving concentration[no headphones works wonders]
4. Do a mini project on something more directly related to AI/ML???


## Reflections

Today kinda sucked! I still feel overwhelmed and frustrated at my general lack of progress, but I know I'm starting out. I really want to get my app done and complete, I have a [SECRET_SIDE_PROJECT] that is taking up a lot of time as well, so I don't have as much as I would like. I also worked quite late today as I am oncall. Despite that I guess I did accomplish a lot in some sense though.

I think the big things I need to improve are:
1. Focus: working without distractions/phones/headphones and pomodoro, keep this up
2. Socializing: need to have things planned in advance on the weekends so I don't spiral
3. Directness, kind of linked with 2, as I think my social skills are sub-par, need to be more assertive and direct, overall I would say i'm passive[maybe the mean but true way to say this is low-agency, although I'm not quite sure this is entirely correct]

## Reflections

Today was exhausting and frustrating, but still fairly good.
Tired all day at work, but got a lot done on projects, and made a lot of progress in many different areas today.
Started running out of steam near the end of the day, and then had to deal with oncall stuff, but overall got enough done that I am not as worried about this.

Had a bookclub with friends that I had to dip out of early as I had 10,0000 people vying for my time, also had virtually no meetings at work but like 4-5 hours of calls after work for various things, which was fairly annoying.

Only got to work on my [secret project] and not my app.
 
On a side note, I really need to play music more. I have fallen out of practice and haven't really been playing like at all recently.

Initially I wanted to get out an album by EOY, while this didn't end up happening I think I have actually been more productive than anticipated by an order of magnitude, just on different sets of things. This does feel partially like giving up a dream though, although I do have to acknowledge that being a musician is just not that important to me anymore - this is probably sad and indicative of something bad. 

Therefore, I need to play more music, I should attempt to budget time in my day for that. Especially during meetings

Update: just played guitar a little to sneak that in for today, I need to go to bed now though

Also I should make this blog less diary style and more focused on actual content, no one wants to read this lmao
