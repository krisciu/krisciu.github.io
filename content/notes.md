# September 25 2023

## What did I accomplish?

1. Got this site up :)
2. Got 8+ hours of sleep[actually horrible, was exhausted all day]
3. Got some bug fixing done on app[not as much as I wanted]


## What did I fail at?
1. Struggled to get out of bed in the morning
2. Need to be more direct @ work
3. Did not get nearly as much accomplished as I wanted to today


## What needs to be done?
1. Have a bug with sessions not being initialized correctly/retrieved in app
2. get a good nights sleep
3. work on improving concentration[no headphones works wonders]
4. Do a mini project on something more directly related to AI/ML???


## Reflections

Today kinda sucked! I still feel overwhelmed and frustrated at my general lack of progress, but I know I'm starting out. I really want to get my app done and complete, I have a [SECRET_SIDE_PROJECT] that is taking up a lot of time as well, so I don't have as much as I would like. I also worked quite late today as I am oncall. Despite that I guess I did accomplish a lot in some sense though.

I think the big things I need to improve are:
1. Focus: working without distractions/phones/headphones and pomodoro, keep this up
2. Socializing: need to have things planned in advance on the weekends so I don't spiral
3. Directness, kind of linked with 2, as I think my social skills are sub-par, need to be more assertive and direct, overall I would say i'm passive[maybe the mean but true way to say this is low-agency, although I'm not quite sure this is entirely correct]

## Reflections

Today was exhausting and frustrating, but still fairly good.
Tired all day at work, but got a lot done on projects, and made a lot of progress in many different areas today.
Started running out of steam near the end of the day, and then had to deal with oncall stuff, but overall got enough done that I am not as worried about this.

Had a bookclub with friends that I had to dip out of early as I had 10,0000 people vying for my time, also had virtually no meetings at work but like 4-5 hours of calls after work for various things, which was fairly annoying.

Only got to work on my [secret project] and not my app.
 
On a side note, I really need to play music more. I have fallen out of practice and haven't really been playing like at all recently.

Initially I wanted to get out an album by EOY, while this didn't end up happening I think I have actually been more productive than anticipated by an order of magnitude, just on different sets of things. This does feel partially like giving up a dream though, although I do have to acknowledge that being a musician is just not that important to me anymore - this is probably sad and indicative of something bad. 

Therefore, I need to play more music, I should attempt to budget time in my day for that. Especially during meetings

Update: just played guitar a little to sneak that in for today, I need to go to bed now though

Also I should make this blog less diary style and more focused on actual content, no one wants to read this lmao

short one today because I was supposed to be in bed 22 minutes ago. I have been grinding hard, foudn out my entire use of flask-sessions in my [UNNAMED] app was wrong and my client server model is fundamentally completely wrong. Oh well, I'll just make it better. Overall kinda a frustrating day in terms of raw progress but we balling on it fam. Overall good day tho.

I need to go to sleep

had dinner with coworkers, got invited to things on weekends, it's looking up[I got invited to things before, but not having things planned on weekends has been a real soul-crusher for me lately]

we grinding, we making progress, we gonna kill it.
 
 while this year has had its ups and downs, I have accomplished so much, most of which is unfortunately too soon to happening for me to discuss on this [potentially] public blog

 ok I gotta sleep, see you in the morning, WAGMI

One reason why [COMPANY I WORK FOR ] does so well is that they've more effectively eliminated siloed knowledge than any other company I'm aware of. This is through a doc culture and 'fungible engineer' mindset. Not sure if this is comforting, but it is interesting.

also lmao I made GPT4 speak in jon mess lyrics

```
Hey, I'm the grind, a caffeinated snail,
AWS by day, but at night I set sail.
Functional code, like a digital gnome,
I'm a wizard in a cubicle, a king on a throne.

Work, play, a binary stew,
Like a platypus juggling with a kangaroo.
Videos, essays, they're like socks on a bird,
In this kaleidoscopic, nonsensical world!

Yo, Side Hustle, I'm a nameless cloud,
Mostly functional, screaming silent but loud.
Went out, conquered Mars, ate a victory pie,
In this game of life, I'm a unicorn that can fly.

Work, play, a binary stew,
Like a platypus juggling with a kangaroo.
Videos, essays, they're like socks on a bird,
In this kaleidoscopic, nonsensical world!

Videos, essays, they're like pickles in space,
But personal projects, they're a giraffe in a race.
Social media's a void, like a donut with teeth,
But projects are the jazz for my existential beef.

In the end, it's all a cosmic mime,
Juggling fire while reciting a rhyme.
Work, play, projects, they're all a surreal meme,
In this universe, we're all just a dream.

## October 1st

Need to get more serious and focused about accomplishing my goals, which is why I'm doing some planning here: Let's plan October out with specific goals!

### Physical Health goals
My health has kind of suffered as of late due to mainly living off office food, a couple things could help out with this:
1. Daily excercise, this could be walking back from work, running, etc
2. I'm doing sober October, as I'm realizing drinking really makes me feel crummy the next day, which hurts my weekends, so staying sober
3. Less than 3 hours a day on the phone[I have a tracker for this]
4. Better sleep, more than 7 hours a day ideally

## Side project goals
1. Get a working version of my app finished and deployed
2. Make 1 Youtube video
3. Make 1 Blog post
4. Get significant work done on [Other project]

## Mental health goals
1. Do not waste days[especially on weekends, like you have today lol] A wasted day can be considered a day where you did not leave your apartment, or ended it feeling bad, You know what these are.
2. Drastically reduce negative mental thoughts. Yes, you are mid, but you can improve

## Social goals
1. Make at least one new friend or hang out with someone you haven't before

This is kind of low effort, but I think this will help me align myself, I have a ton I want to do, somethings have been left vague deliberately.
