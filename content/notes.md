# September 25 2023

## What did I accomplish?

1. Got this site up :)
2. Got 8+ hours of sleep[actually horrible, was exhausted all day]
3. Got some bug fixing done on app[not as much as I wanted]


## What did I fail at?
1. Struggled to get out of bed in the morning
2. Need to be more direct @ work
3. Did not get nearly as much accomplished as I wanted to today


## What needs to be done?
1. Have a bug with sessions not being initialized correctly/retrieved in app
2. get a good nights sleep
3. work on improving concentration[no headphones works wonders]
4. Do a mini project on something more directly related to AI/ML???


## Reflections

Today kinda sucked! I still feel overwhelmed and frustrated at my general lack of progress, but I know I'm starting out. I really want to get my app done and complete, I have a [SECRET_SIDE_PROJECT] that is taking up a lot of time as well, so I don't have as much as I would like. I also worked quite late today as I am oncall. Despite that I guess I did accomplish a lot in some sense though.

I think the big things I need to improve are:
1. Focus: working without distractions/phones/headphones and pomodoro, keep this up
2. Socializing: need to have things planned in advance on the weekends so I don't spiral
3. Directness, kind of linked with 2, as I think my social skills are sub-par, need to be more assertive and direct, overall I would say i'm passive[maybe the mean but true way to say this is low-agency, although I'm not quite sure this is entirely correct]
