# Videos

Here is a list of the current videos I have available, on a variety of topics related to ML

1. [Understanding the Softmax Function for Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPZ4RIkg3dU&)
   
   A quick video about the Softmax function!

2. [Multilayer Perceptrons for Machine Learning!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeL2zeIurNE&)
   
   Scaling up from linear neural nets to multilayer perceptrons, with some common activation functions included!

3. [Introduction to Language Models for Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeL2zeIurNE&)

    A brief intro to the fundamentals of how language models work, I eventually want to make a part 2 on Recurrent Neural Networks!

4. [Linear Regression for Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeL2zeIurNE&)
   
   A quick one going over Linear Regression!
